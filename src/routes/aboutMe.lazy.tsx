          Hi, you can call me Carol! üòä I'm a Brazilian designer living in
          Portugal. I have more than 6 years of experience in Design and
          Illustration, working with Product Design, Graphic Design, and
          Illustration for digital and printed services.
          <br />
          <br />
          For the last 4 years, I've focused my career on Product Design. I love
          creating pleasant experiences for users while adding value to the
          company's business. As an illustrator, I also bring this skill to
          everyday life, contributing with icons and customized illustration
          libraries.
          <br />
          <br />
          Below, I'll share some photos of the companies I've worked for,
          courses I've enjoyed and even an illustration I created for the Design
          Team of one of the companies where I made great friends. Later on,
          I'll also tell you a bit about my personal side.

          Well, I think it's important to know a little about Carol beyond the
          professional side. After all, a lot of what we are in our personal
          lives says a lot about who we are at work, doesn't it?
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm a little nerd who loves getting lost in the world of imagination.
          I always say that my imagination has saved me at various times in my
          life. It's what I use to do the things I love most: play tabletop
          role-playing games with my friends (I'm a player as well as a dungeon
          master), draw, write stories and talk about silly things at an
          afternoon coffee table or on a pizza night.
          <br />
          <br />
          I love telling stories, dancing, drinking coffee, listening to people
          laugh, playing with dogs, playing video games and, of course,
          collecting Taylor Swift stuff.
          <br />
          <br />
          I think that as long as I have my creativity and imagination, no
          matter how much I get lost in life-I'll always come back to myself.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fun fact: I have a degree in Veterinary Medicine! Before diving 100%
          into design, I fulfilled every child's (and my) childhood dream of
          becoming a veterinarian. As an outspoken curiosity seeker, I love
          studying animals. So if you need any health tips for your pet or any
          trivia about the area, just give me a call! üòä
